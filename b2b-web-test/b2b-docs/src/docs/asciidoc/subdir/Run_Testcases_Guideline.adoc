#How to run the test cases locally on build server in B2b mobile test automation.#

1: Always run maven lifecycle before executing your testcases, Maven lifecycle helps to run our testcases smoothly.

*Maven Commands:*

Three are crucial for Selenium test automation. There are clean, compile, and tests.

   * *Clean*- It would clean the target folder, i.e. the folder where the previous buildâ€™s libraries, build files(war, tar or jar files), reports, output files, etc are saved. On executing mvn -clean this target folder will be deleted.

   * *Compile*- It compiles the source code, converts the .java files to .class and stores the classes in target/classes folder.

   * *Test*- It will simply run the test without creating any deployment file.


2: Ways of running a feature file from Command Line on build server:- 
   
   A. One way If you are using Maven and want to run a subset of scenarios tagged with @tagName.

   * command: mvn clean test -D cucumber.filter.tags="@tagName"

   B. Second way how to run single feature file from the command line, then use the below syntax:-

   * command: mvn test -Dcucumber.options="complete feature file path"

      eg:  mvn test -Dcucumber.options="src/test/resources/features/CucumberTagsExample.feature"

   C. If we want to run a single Scenario from the command line and no tag is assigned to that scenario, this is how we specify

   * command: mvn test -Dcucumber.options="complete feature file path:line number", Include feature file path and line number of the testCase.
   
     eg: mvn test -Dcucumber.options="src/test/resources/features/CucumberTagsExample.feature:12"
